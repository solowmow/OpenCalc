# OpenCalc - Mobile Calculator with Web3 Wallet Integration

OpenCalc is an open-source mobile calculator application that integrates Web3 wallet functionalities and smart contract connectivity. This repository contains the codebase for the application, featuring a backend, a frontend, a Solidity smart contract, and SQL database integration.

## Features

- **Web3 Wallet Integration:** Seamlessly connect your Web3 wallet to manage cryptocurrencies while performing calculations.
- **Smart Contract Connectivity:** Utilize smart contracts to securely execute transactions within the app.
- **Advanced Calculator Functionalities:** Comprehensive mathematical operations for diverse calculation needs.
- **Backend and Frontend Frameworks:** Node.js, Express for backend, React Native for frontend.

## File Structure

The repository structure is organized as follows:

- `contracts/`: Contains the Solidity smart contract file(s).
- `backend/`: Holds the backend Node.js files for server logic and interaction with the smart contract.
- `frontend/`: Includes the frontend codebase, particularly the React Native components.

## Usage

### Setup Instructions

1. **Smart Contract Deployment:** Deploy the smart contract on the Ethereum blockchain.
2. **Backend Setup:** Configure the backend server, ensuring it connects to your Ethereum node.
3. **Frontend Setup:** Set up the React Native environment and configure the frontend to interact with the backend.

### Running the Application

1. Start the backend server:
   ```bash
   cd backend/
   node server.js
